# Microscopic Fabric Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying different fabric types based on **microscopic images** taken at **60x magnification**. The dataset contains multiple fabric categories, with each category stored in a separate folder. The microscopic images clearly show fiber texture, weave patterns, and surface characteristics that help differentiate natural and synthetic fabrics.

## 🔍 Project Objective
- Analyze microscopic fabric images to identify fiber structure and weave pattern
- Build a labeled dataset of fabric categories
- Train a machine learning model to automatically classify fabric types
- Support textile industry quality control and material identification
